**Grad CAM** was applied on the [DenseNet](https://github.com/genigarus/GradCam/blob/master/GradCamOnModelCIFAR10.ipynb) model used in Assignment 4 to view 50 misclassified images of CIFAR 10 dataset.
Here are few examples of the misclassified images along with the heatmaps of result generated by Grad CAM superimposed on it.
