# Grad CAM

**Grad CAM** was applied on the [DenseNet](https://github.com/genigarus/GradCam/blob/master/GradCamOnModelCIFAR10.ipynb) or [DenseNet (improved resolution)](https://github.com/genigarus/GradCam/blob/master/GradCamOnMyModel_CIFAR10.ipynb) model used in Assignment 4 to view 50 misclassified images of CIFAR 10 dataset.
Here is an example of misclassified image along with the heatmaps of result generated by Grad CAM superimposed on it.

**Examples** folder contain Grad CAM applied on different classification models for CIFAR 10 dataset.

**Asset** Folder:

The below folders contain misclassified images along with the heatmaps of result generated by Grad CAM superimposed on it
1) **Images** (in larger size with 40% of heatmap imposed on image)
2) **MisclassifiedImages** (in smaller size with 50% of heatmap imposed on image)
